# antlr-template
[Antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) is  (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.

This project is just a **small template** to start working on it.

## Grammar
Antlr allows us specify a grammar in an [extended Backusâ€“Naur](https://tomassetti.me/ebnf/) form (EBNF)

In this [repository](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4) it is available a list of grammar examples:
 * [Json](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/json)
 * [Kotlin](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/kotlin)
 * [HTTP](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/http/http.g4)

## Recommended
Install the [ANTLR v4 plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358-antlr-v4) allows visualise the parsing a text using a grammar, it displays errors if the text is not correct or shos the tree of the parsed text.
